# final_project


In the README file for your project, use Markdown to include all of the following information:
* A video of your program running (1min or less, no voiceover)


* Summarize program's functionality (what does it do?) and purpose (why does it exist and/or who is it for?)

Hello. TBCB Dogfighters is a turn based, card based, WWII dogfighting simulator. In this game, you can play against a computer controlled opponent or another player. Your goal is to use a selection of cards to successfully down your opponent. There are three potential endgame scenarios. You can win by
shooting down your foe, you can draw by disengaging, and you can lose if your foe successfully shoots you down.




* A description, with code segments, of a "breakthrough moment" in which you solved a particularly difficult problem, learned to do something new, or independently overcame being stuck
* An explanation of data abstraction as it is used in your program.
- Include code segments that show where data is being stored and where data is being retrived and accompanying explanation.
- Identify what the abstracted data represents in your program
- Explain how the selected abstraction manages complexity in your program code (why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not abstract the data in the way you did)
* An explanation of procedural abstraction as it is used in your program.
- Include a single code segment containing:
* A procedure
- with a parameter (i.e., takes an argument)
* and includes an algorithm
- that uses sequencing, selection, and iteration
* and returns a value
- that depends on the arguments given when the procedure is called
* and is called from elsewhere in the program
- Explain how the algorithm in the above code segment functions and why it is important for the purpose of your program
- Explain how the procedural abstraction helps to manage complexity in your program (be specific!)
* Markdown syntax can be found here:
